This repository will hold the project for the course Advanced Programming Techniques of Data Science in the University of Florence.  
This project resembles a skeleton of a contact managing application that can store, delete and update contacts from a storage or equivalent. The application is intended to be kept simple because the focus of the project was the usage of the techniques learned during the course, such as TDD, continuous integration, GIT, docker, mutation testing and more.
